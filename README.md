## Project Purpose

skyVue is being designed to become a intuitive and accessible satellite tracking web application, that requires zero prior knowledge on the subject. At the same time, it is going to offer a complete suit of tools which unfold gradually as the users explore its options. 

 Moreover, it serves as a central hub for curated educational content on satellite tracking. 
 
 Once refined, I plan to release a generalized template for creating tracking systems with graphical interfaces.
