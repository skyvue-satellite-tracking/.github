## Project Purpose

skyVue is being designed to become a intuitive and accessible satellite tracking web application, that requires net zero prior knowledge on the subject, at the same time being a complete 
collection of tools which unfolds gradually as the user's explorer the interface. Also, it is a hub for finding sellected content for learning about satellite tracking.

When the project is refined enough, I intend to release a more generall template for creating tracking systems with graphical interfaces.
